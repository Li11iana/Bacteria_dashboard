Belly-button bacteria from 160 samples showcased on a Javascript Dashboard

## Overview
In this project the data collected from belly-button biological samples is organized and visualized in order to facilitate its study for a syntethic beef manufacturing company *Improbable Beef*. Additionally, this dashboard will make the bacterial information easily available for the volunteers that submitted samples without exposing their identities while the researchers at *Improbable Beef* can access the demographic information for each sample while mantaining privacy, a key concern when dealing with clinical data. 

### Objective
* Create a customized dashboard using Javascript and Plotly to showcase the bacterial species collected from 160 samples.

## Summary
In order to display the demographic information for each sample in the dataset the following charts were created. These information can be accesed using the sample code that mantains the identity of the volunteer private.

* Gauge Chart

As shown above, the graphs are informative and the dashboard functional for both the volunteer to learn about the results of the testing of their samples as well as a useful source for additional information for the researchers in case of finding a species of interest among the samples.
